# Installation
- Download the latest .pak file from Releases section.
- Put the .pak file to your game data folder. (Ex: /sdcard/xash/cstrike)
- Launch the game.
# For configure the menu (like changing buttons color, menu type etc.)
- Download "alp_cs16menuext.cfg" file from Releases and put it to your game data folder then open it with text mode and change the values which are given between double quotation marks.
- Note: When adding "alp_cs16menuext.cfg" file, be sure to put two .pak and .cfg files into the same directory.
# If the menu doesn't work
- You may use numerical menu. Go to Multiplayer > Customize > Game options, find "Buy menu type" then use arrows and change to "VGUI menus" or type "_vgui_menus 1" in the console.
- Check the other .pak files in the same folder. Some .pak files can overlap if they uses the same named files in the same directories. if there's more, remove them out of it then launch the game again.
- Check the touch folder and .cfg files in it, because this menu uses buy config files. So you should remove them too.
- Try to create a new folder named "custom" in the same folder then move the .pak file into it (This method is recommended)
- Still same? Maybe you should check the path (which configs, game saves, etc. are stored) in the Xash3D App.
