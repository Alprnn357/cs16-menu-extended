# CS 1.6 Menu Extended For CS16Client Android
Features:
- Re-designed Team and Buy Menu
- Big VGUI Buttons
- Easy to use
- Scoreboard in Team Menu
- All weapons with prices
- Support Zombie Scenario game mode from CSMoE (Scoreboard drops behind in Team Menu due to some changes in CSMoE).
# Installation
- Download the .pak file from Releases section.
- Put the .pak file to your game data folder. (Ex: /sdcard/xash/cstrike)
- Launch the game.
# If the menu doesn't work
- Check the other .pak files in the same folder. Some .pak files can overlap if they uses the same named files in the same directories. if there's more, remove them out of it then launch the game again.
- Check the touch folder and .cfg files in it, because this menu uses buy config files. So you should remove them too.
- Try to create a new folder named "custom" in the same folder then move the .pak file into it (This method is recommended)
- Still same? Maybe you should check the path (which configs, game saves, etc. are stored) in the Xash3D App.
